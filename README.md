# Ethereum Data Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that are focused on analyzing Ethereum blockchain data and text data using Python and PySpark.

## Notebooks

### 1. Ethereum Transaction Data Analysis (`etherscanAnalysis.ipynb`)

#### Overview
"etherscanAnalysis.ipynb" is designed for analyzing Ethereum transaction data. It utilizes Python standard libraries and PySpark for large-scale data processing.

#### Key Features
- **Data Import and Setup**: Importing libraries and setting file paths for Ethereum transaction data.
- **Python Data Processing**: Handling large CSV files, filtering, and processing Ethereum transaction data.
- **PySpark Data Processing**: Employing PySpark for distributed computing to further process the transaction data.

### 2. Word Cloud Generation from Text Data (`wordCloudPlot.ipynb`)

#### Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of generating a word cloud from text data, leveraging PySpark and Python libraries.

#### Key Features
- **PySpark Initialization**: Setting up a Spark session for distributed data processing.
- **Text Data Processing**: Reading and processing text data to compute word frequencies.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Creating a visual representation of the most frequent words in the text data.

## Usage

To use these notebooks, clone the repository and open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment with PySpark installed. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed as mentioned in each notebook.
